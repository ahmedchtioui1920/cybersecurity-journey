# üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability & Exploit Notes

## üîç Automated vs Manual Vulnerability Research

| Method       | Advantages                                | Disadvantages                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Automated    | Fast scanning, finds known issues easily   | False positives, may miss logic flaws         |
| Manual       | More accurate, finds logic/complex issues  | Time-consuming, requires human expertise      |

## üß† Common Vulnerability Types

### 1. Security Misconfiguration
Occurs when software or systems are not securely configured (e.g., default credentials, open ports).

### 2. Broken Access Control
Allows users to access resources or actions beyond their privilege level.

### 3. Insecure Deserialization
Untrusted or malformed input leads to remote code execution during deserialization.

### 4. Injection
Injecting untrusted data (e.g., SQL, OS commands) into a program, often leading to full control.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Exploit Discovery

- Public exploits are often shared on GitHub.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not all GitHub code is trustworthy. Some PoCs may be malicious or misnamed.
- Use `searchsploit` on Kali Linux to find exploits safely offline.
