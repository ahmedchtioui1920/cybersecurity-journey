# Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my **2-week intensive learning path in Offensive Security**, focusing on building practical skills in penetration testing, Red Teaming, and cybersecurity fundamentals. It contains hands-on exercises, labs, scripts, and notes from TryHackMe, OverTheWire, and other resources.

## ðŸ“… Learning Plan Overview

### **Week 1: Build Core Skills + Start Offensive Tools**
| Day | Topics | Goal |
|-----|--------|------|
| 1   | Linux + Bash | Understand file system, permissions, navigation, scripting |
| 2   | Networking Basics | Grasp IP, MAC, ARP, Subnetting, Routing |
| 3   | Nmap + Enumeration | Learn Nmap flags, scan types, script usage |
| 4   | Web Basics + Burp Suite | Learn Burp features: repeater, proxy, intruder |
| 5   | Vulnerabilities & Exploits | Understand SQLi, XSS, SSRF, IDOR, Auth issues |
| 6   | Metasploit + Basic Exploits | Scan â†’ Exploit â†’ Shell â†’ Post-exploitation basics |
| 7   | CTF Practice Day | Apply tools in mini-lab; write short report |

### **Week 2: Offensive Security Tools, Red Teaming Intro, Automation, Reporting**
| Day | Topics | Goal |
|-----|--------|------|
| 8   | Bash Scripting + Automation | Automate small recon tasks (e.g., Nmap â†’ Grep) |
| 9   | Python for Pentesters | Python mini tools for scanning and info gathering |
| 10  | Red Teaming Intro | Understand Red Team tactics and attack stages |
| 11  | C2 Frameworks + Enumeration | Get a reverse shell + local enumeration manually |
| 12  | Windows Fundamentals + AD | Grasp Windows internals, privilege escalation |
| 13  | Reporting + Proof of Concept | Learn documentation best practices for pentesting |
| 14  | Final CTF + Self-Assessment | End-to-end simulated pentest task and evaluation |
