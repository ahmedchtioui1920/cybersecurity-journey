## ðŸ’¥ Task 14: Example Attack â€” XSS Injection (Manual)
**Scenario**: Target web app has a contact form with an email input field.

**Steps:**

2. Visit the `/contact` page in browser and fill the form.
3. Burp intercepts the request (Intercept ON).
4. Modify the email field:
   ```
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
5. Forward the request.
6. Observe a successful XSS popup when the page loads or response renders the script.
