## ✅ Included Tools

### 1. TCP Port Scanner
Scans a target for open ports using socket connection.

- **Use:** `tcp_port_scanner("example.com")`

### 3. Subdomain Finder
Attempts to discover if certain common subdomains exist (e.g., `mail.example.com`).

- **Use:** `subdomain_finder("example.com")`
- **Explanation:** Makes HTTP requests to common subdomains and checks response.

### 4. WHOIS Lookup
Performs a WHOIS query on a domain to get registration details.

- **Use:** `whois_lookup("example.com")`
- **Explanation:** Prints out domain registrar, creation date, expiry, etc.

### 5. DNS Lookup
Resolves a domain name to its IP address using DNS.

- **Use:** `dns_lookup("example.com")`
- **Explanation:** Uses the system’s DNS resolver to find the A record (IPv4).
