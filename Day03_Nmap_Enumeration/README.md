# Day 03 - Nmap & Enumeration

This folder contains self-contained notes, examples, sample output and an automation script for learning and practicing Nmap scanning and manual enumeration techniques.  
Work through the files in this order:

1. `nmap_notes.md` — detailed Nmap explanations & examples  
2. `nmap_recon_script.sh` — run to automate basic recon (make executable)  
3. `nmap_scan_results.txt` — sample scan output to study and use in reports  
4. `enumeration_notes.md` — manual enumeration commands & service-specific guidance

> Goal: after studying and practicing these notes and examples you should be able to:
> - run targeted Nmap scans and interpret results
> - choose appropriate NSE scripts for further checks
> - perform manual enumeration for common services (FTP, SSH, HTTP, SMB)
> - collect and save recon output suitable for a short PoC/report
